## Technical Details
- Built with Vue 3 Composition API
- Uses Vite as build tool
- Fetches data from Numbers API with local fallback
- Responsive design with CSS3
- Modular component structure



## Troubleshooting
If encounter any issues:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:
bash
npm install
2. Clear npm cache if needed:
